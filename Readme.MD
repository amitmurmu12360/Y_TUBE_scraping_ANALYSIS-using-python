I build a Python Project to Scrape YouTube data using YouTube Data API. Using YouTube API, I extract the data and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then analyze this data. Finally, I build simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn library.

Link to create YouTube API Key: https://console.cloud.google.com/


I start this project by first creating an YouTube API Key which will be my credential to access youtube data. 
Once the API Key is generated, i have then learn how to use this API key to access different youtube data. I.e. i will walk through the documentation given by google to use youtube API. i have look at the different sections in the documentation to access different data i need to build this project. i have also look at the sample python code given by google to call different resources and methods to fetch youtube data.

Finally, i have get into writing the python code to build this project. I haved be using Jupyter Notebook to write my python code. Since it is a new project, i have create a new virtual environment for this project.i have use anaconda for this. Once the virtual environment is set, i have then install all the required python packages. So i had install "google-api-python-client" (which is the google python package required to access youtube api data), i have also install pandas and seaborn. I had showed  how to create a virtual environment and also how to install all these packages in detail.

Once my environment is set and required packages are installed,i have then start writing the code in Jupyter Notebook. I have divided this project into 2 parts.
In the first part, i had extract channel details from youtube. I.e. i had extract details such as youtube channel name, total no of subscribers, total views and total number of videos posted by each channel. i gathered these details for few Data Analyst/Data Scientist kind of channel and then compare these channel data with each other. i shall see who has the highest subscriber and who gets the most views and the amount of videos posted by these channels. i have loading all of this data into a pandas dataframe and then analyze it. i had also generated some basic visualization using this data so i can easily compare these multiple channels.
THANKYOY!!!!!
